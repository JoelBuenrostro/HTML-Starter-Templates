# Cpntributing to HTML Starter Templates

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should have clearer descriptions

## Coding conventions

* We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
* We use HAML for all views
* We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters ([1, 2, 3], not [1,2,3]), around operators (x += 1, not x+=1), and around hash arrows.
* This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.
